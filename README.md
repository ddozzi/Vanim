Valorant kill banner animations for Minecraft.

## Information
- Currently only supports the default kill animation (couldn't find any other kill banner animations)
- Requires internet on first startup because it needs to download resources

## Contributing
- Since this project uses Essentials by Sk1er, you need to add this to the JVM arguments.
```
--tweakClass gg.essential.loader.stage0.EssentialSetupTweaker
```
- The most useful contributions at this time would be more animations.

## Credits
- Credits to TheRandomYordle2 for the kill banner animations. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfu_WZ6p51U)
  - Video was downloaded and animations were individually extracted using OpenCV and FFMPEG
